# Workshop (W45-2022) during the DAWAN .NET Developer training cycle 
For this free subject I decided to realize the Razor Pages with Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core tutorial/ContosoUniversity from the Learn Microsoft platform (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio).
I think it's a good choice because it allows me to pratice the use of the Entity Framework and familiarize myself with Razor Pages structure and construction.
